# Project Title

RMUTTOBot: Transforming University Admission Services with a RAG-Based LLM Chatbot

## Description

RMUTTOBot is an intelligent chatbot system designed to enhance and streamline university admission services at Rajamangala University of Technology Tawan-Ok (RMUTTO). Built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), the bot provides accurate, real-time responses to admission-related inquiries by leveraging structured data sources. This project aims to reduce administrative workload, improve student support, and modernize service delivery through a conversational AI interface. RMUTTOBot is developed using Flutter for cross-platform support, Gemini 1.5 Flash for LLM capabilities, and Firebase for backend services.
